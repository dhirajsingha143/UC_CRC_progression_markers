2. Large-scale whole blood RNA-Seq identifies transcriptional differences between primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis 
(Submitter supplied) Background: Patients suffering from primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) often also have ulcerative colitis (UC). Cross-disease genetic and microbiome studies across PSC und UC patients indicated that UC in PSC is a separate disease entity from primary UC, but expression studies for PSC are lacking. In this study, we performed a molecular comparison of whole blood expression levels in PSC only, PSC patients with additional UC diagnosis (PSC/UC), and UC, using a large collection of whole blood transcriptome data. more...

13. Longitudinal Rectal tissue DNA methylation Profiling Identifies Cell-specific Signatures for Disease severity and Outcome in Ulcerative Colitis
(Submitter supplied) Ulcerative colitis is heritable disorder with variable clinical outcome but to date only less than 10% of the disease susceptibility and the disease outcome is explained by IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) associated genetic loci. This missing heritability lay fertile grounds for investigating epigenetics as possible explanation. The aims of the study were to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation of the rectal tissue in an inception cohort of UC at two time points, once at baseline (treatment naïve) and at follow-up to explore how longitudinal DNA methylation influences the disease onset, disease progression and outcome. more...

16. Vedolizumab efficacy is associated with decreased intracolonic dendritic cells, not memory T cells [P444]
(Submitter supplied) Background: Vedolizumab, an antibody blocking integrin α4β7, is a safe and effective therapy for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Blocking α4β7 from binding its cognate addressin MAdCAM-1 on intestinal blood vessel endothelial cells prevents T cells from migrating to the gut mucosa in animal models. However, data supporting this mechanism of action in humans is limited. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study to evaluate the effect of vedolizumab on intestinal immune cell populations while avoiding the confounding effect resolving inflammation could have on the cellularity of the colonic mucosa in treatment-responsive patients. more...

Blocking α4β7 from binding its cognate addressin MAdCAM-1 on intestinal blood vessel endothelial cells prevents T cells from migrating to the gut mucosa in animal models. However, data supporting this mechanism of action in humans is limited. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study to evaluate the effect of vedolizumab on intestinal immune cell populations while avoiding the confounding effect resolving inflammation could have on the cellularity of the colonic mucosa in treatment-responsive patients. more...

161. Elevated colonic mucin expression correlates with extended time to surgery for ulcerative colitis patients
(Submitter supplied) Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) develops from chronic inflammation of the colon. Most patients respond favorably to medical management, however around 25% of UC patients will require surgery to treat their disease. While surgery is the only curative treatment for UC, it can carry its own risks, particularly when the surgery is emergent. Time from diagnosis to surgery varies dramatically amongst UC patients, thus a better understanding of how the colonic microenvironment relates to disease severity is needed to improve patient outcomes. more...

196. Gene expression data of human normal colon organoids stimulated by IL-17A
(Submitter supplied) With aging, normal human tissues experience expansion of somatic clones that carry cancer mutations. However, whether such clonal expansion exists in the non-neoplastic intestine remains unknown. Here, from whole exome sequencing of 76 clonal human colon organoids, we identify a unique pattern of somatic mutagenesis in the inflamed epithelium of ulcerative colitis patients. The affected epithelium accumulates somatic mutations in multiple IL-17 signaling-related genes, including NFKBIZ, ZC3H12A, and PIGR, which are rarely identified in colon cancer. more...

205. Effect of ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1 during TNF-induced HT-29 cells apoptosis
(Submitter supplied) Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Previous study showed that the immunological impairment elicted the alteration of inflammatory mediators, and ferroptosis was implicated with the lethal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).We have already found that lipid ROS level was elevated in both murine DSS colitis model and TNF-a-induced cell apoptosis model in vitro.Then we here use two ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1 trying to eliminate lipid ROS in order to relive the symptoms of colitis.But we strikingly notice that liproxstatin-1 could increase TNF-induced cell apoptosis instead of protecting cells from death as we expected before while the other inhibitor ferrostatin-1 could protect cells from death indeed.To evaluate the underlying mechanism, we performed the experiment using high-throughput sequencing and get data to explain the reason why liproxstatin-1 could increase TNF-induced cell apoptosis .

228. Transcriptional imprinting of transmigrating neutrophils on T84 intestinal epithelial cells
(Submitter supplied) Neutrophil accumulation in crypt abscesses is a pathological hallmark of ulcerative colitis.  Based on recent evidence that mucosal metabolic changes influence disease outcomes, we hypothesized that transmigrating neutrophils influence the transcriptional profile of intestinal epithelia.  Microarray studies revealed a cohort of hypoxia-responsive genes regulated by neutrophil-epithelial crosstalk. Real-time O2 sensing indicated that transmigrating neutrophils rapidly deplete microenvironmental O2 sufficient enough to stabilize intestinal epithelial cell hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). more...
