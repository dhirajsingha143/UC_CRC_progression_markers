1. Gene Expression Data from Human Peripheral Blood
(Submitter supplied) Early diagnosis of cancer has been shown to substantially improve 5-year survival rates for many cancer types. With current methodologies early diagnosis has proven difficult for cancers of deep tissues, such as the pancreas and lung. However, whole peripheral blood has been demonstrated to be a promising non-invasive surrogate tissue for the detection of many types of cancer. Blood samples were collected in EDTA blood collection tubes from 2,485 human volunteers and gene expression profiled with the goal to develop a classification model that differentiations patients with cancer from those without cancer.

2. Characterizing transcriptomic differences between between primary colorectal adenocarcinomas and distant metastases reveals subtypes of metastatic colorectal cancer
(Submitter supplied) We present a novel approach for investigating transcriptomic differences between primary colorectal cancers (CRC) and distant CRC metastases, which may help to identify primaries at high risk for future dissemination and to inform the development of metastasis-targeted therapies. Eliminating tissue specificity of the “host” organs where tumors are located and adjusting for confounders such as exposure to chemotherapy and radiation, allows for an effective comparison of primary CRC and metastatic lesion transcriptomes at both the gene and pathway levels. more...

23. Replacement of nitrite in meat products by natural bioactive compounds results in reduced exposure to N-nitroso compounds: the PHYTOME project
(Submitter supplied) It has been proposed that endogenously formed N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) are partly responsible for the link between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. As nitrite has been indicated as one of the critical factors in the formation of endogenous NOCs, it is of high importance to replace or reduce the nitrite levels in meat. Therefore, the PHYTOME project was initiated (Phytochemicals to reduce nitrite in meat products; www.phytome.eu), an EU funded research project aiming to develop innovative meat products in which the food additive sodium nitrite (E251) has been replaced by natural compounds originating from fruits and vegetables. more...

127. Deciphering cellular states of innate tumor drug responses
(Submitter supplied) Clinical drug resistance is one major concern in the treatment of human cancers, most of them being found resistant to therapy at the time of drug presentation. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that contribute to such innate drug resistance should improve both the prediction of treatment failure and the development of new strategies to overcome resistance. Our study reports for the first time a systems approach toward understanding the in vivo cellular states of clinical samples collected from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients prior to their exposure to combined chemotherapy of folinic acid (FA), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan (CPT-11). more...

About half of these patients develop adenomas by age 15, and 95% develop adenomas by age 35. AFAP patients exhibit a milder phenotype than CFAP patients; AFAP is characterized by fewer polyps, later adenoma onset, and lower CRC risk. more...

173. Canonical BMP signaling executes epithelial-mesenchymal transition downstream of SNAIL1
(Submitter supplied) Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a pivotal process in development and disease. In carcinogenesis, various signaling pathways are known to trigger EMT by inducing the expression of EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs) like SNAIL1, ultimately promoting invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. However, how EMT is executed downstream of EMT-TFs is incompletely understood. Here, using human colorectal cancer (CRC) and mammary cell line models of EMT, we demonstrate that SNAIL1 critically relies on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling for EMT execution. more...

252. Niche microenvironments are essential for maintaining the phenotypic heterogeneity of primary cancer
(Submitter supplied) Cancer is among the major causes of death worldwide, and treatment can be individualized according to a patient’s genotype. Primary cultures of cancer and normal cells provide more accurate information about tumour pathology compared with tumour-derived cell lines, and several methods are available for establishing primary cultures. However, these methods are inefficient, complicated and expensive. Here we describe a method to establish primary cultures of tumour cells, which we designate “isolated tumour-derived Cancer Cells” (iCCs) that retains the phenotypic heterogeneity of primary cancer cells in their in situ niche microenvironments. We used a custom filter, a Matrigel-coated plate, and modified embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture medium to isolate iCCs from tumour tissues of patients with colorectal cancer. All iCCs were viable, and approximately 90% of the cultures were passaged. The morphologies, genotypes and transcription profiles of iCCs were similar to those of their respective tumours of origin. Further, iCCs comprised a specific cell population that expressed Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), which contributes to forming the structure of the original ductal carcinoma. Our results demonstrate that ESC culture medium maintained the heterogeneity of ICCs by supporting the viability of PDGFR-expressing cells. The responses of iCCs to standard anti-cancer drugs differed compared with those of colon cancer cell lines. Moreover, the drug sensitivities of iCCs closely correlated with patients’ clinical outcomes. For example, a clinically significant finding was the reduction of the IC50 of crenolanib, an inhibitor of PDGFR signalling, for iCCs. Therefore, crenolanib may serve as an effective chemotherapeutic agent for managing colorectal cancer.

253. Mucosal biopsies from groups Normal (NOR) and patients who underwent curative large bowel resection for colorectal cancer  (M-CRC)
(Submitter supplied) The challenge of preventing colorectal cancer (CRC) is the early identification of individuals whose apparently normal colorectal mucosa will develop cancer, because of inherited trait or environmental exposure. We sought to use genome-wide expression profiling of endoscopic biopsies to detect a signature of propensity for cancer. We performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis of normal appearing mucosa of the following cases: healthy individuals (NOR), disease-free carriers predisposed to HNPCC (hereditary non-polyposis CRC), disease-free patients who underwent curative large bowel resection for CRC 1 to 15  years earlier and patients with CRC (MCRC) (GSE23011). more...

We identified thousands of variant enhancer loci (VELs) that comprise a signature that is robustly predictive of the in vivo colon cancer transcriptome. more...

283. Genome-wide expression profiling of CRC cells (SW620) upon TIMELESS loss expression and/or ZEB1 down regulation
(Submitter supplied) Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Recent studies pinpointed TIMELESS (TIM) to be crucially involved in replication protection/genomic stability, DNA damage response (DDR) and coordination of mitotic kinase activation with DNA replication termination. Here we present the first direct evidence of a TIM-ZEB1 axis which control key pathological processes in CRC. We found that loss of TIM expression unleashes ZEB1 which triggers epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program, cell migration/invasion increase and acquirement of stem-like phenotype of CRC cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Increasing evidence suggested that small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) were master regulators of gene regulation at epigenetic modification level, however, the underlying mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been investigated. To demonstrate the involvement of LncRNA and snoRNAs in 2’-O-methylation (Me) in tumorigenesis, we develop the LncRNAs-snoRNAs microarray of paired CRC tissues, and found an unrecognized ZFAS1-NOP58- SNORD12C/78 signaling axis in CRC tumorigenesis through recognizing the consensus AAGA motif of ZFAS1 which directly binds to NOP58 protein, and accelerating the snoRNPs assemble for further guiding 2’-O-Me of 28S rRNA. more...

329. WNT activated cells are the origin of regrowth of colorectal cancer organoids after irradiation
(Submitter supplied) Regeneration capacity of intestinal epithelial cells are highly dependent on the status of stemness. In the homeostasis, only a small subset of stem cells is responsible for the turnover of the intestinal epithelium. However, at the injury, such as caused by radiation, intestinal epithelial cells show substantial plasticity for regeneration. Most of the colorectal cancers (CRCs) are differentiated adenocarcinoma, which maintain the expression of both stemness and differentiation markers, suggesting an existence of a similar regeneration system as in normal cells, although the role of such fluctuation of stemness in regeneration of cancer after irradiation is not well understood. more...
